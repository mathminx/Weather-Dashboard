# Weather Dashboard

## Description

This weather dashboard retrieves weather data for a city chosen by the user. The application includes a search option, a list of cities previously searched, along with current weather conditions and a five-day forecast for the selected city. If a new city is input (i.e. one that has not previously been searched), it is added to the list of searched cities, which is saved to local storage.The weather data is retrieved from https://openweathermap.org using coordinates rather than a city name. The application runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS. 


GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the wind speed
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
