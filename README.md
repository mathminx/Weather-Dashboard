## Description

This weather dashboard retrieves weather data for a city chosen by the user. The application includes a search option, a list of cities previously searched, along with current weather conditions and a five-day forecast for the selected city. If a new city is input (i.e. one that has not previously been searched), it is added to the list of searched cities, which is saved to local storage.The weather data is retrieved from https://openweathermap.org using coordinates rather than a city name. The application runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS. 


## Installation

The project is deployed via GitHub Pages.


## Usage

When you open the application, you are presented with the landing page.

From here, you can enter a city in the input box and click the `Enter` button.
